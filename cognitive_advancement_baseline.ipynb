            "Sentence 194: (1) Dimension of Impact: Economic   (2-a) GDP can be used to measure the impact of Internet.  For Internet: Positive impact to GDP According to a McKinsey Report, Internet has contributed to an average of 3.4% of GDP in larger economies and up to 70% of global GDP. As the Internet has positively contributed to the GDP globally, Internet has a positive impact to the economy.   For AI: Positive impact to GDP in advanced economies, negative impact to GDP in less-advanced economies AI replacing low-level jobs in advanced economies allows these economies to divert these resources for low-level jobs to other high-level sectors such as technology research. These high-level sectors have a greater impact to GDP than low-level jobs, and thus AI would be able to increase the GDP in economies that are developing these sectors. However, AI replaces low-level jobs globally means that less-advanced economies that do not yet have the technical know-how to divert their resources in other sectors would have to suffer the lowered demand of their expertise. This causes their GDP to fall compared to without AI.   (2-b) Employment rate can be used to measure the impact of Internet For Internet: Positive impact on employment rate The Internet has risen job finding rate by 9% for people who use it compared those who do not. The increase in job finding rate is due to the workers being more informed on the company's information, and thus able to make more confident decisions regarding the employers to seek out. When workers are working for companies that fit their criteria, they would naturally remain in the company for longer periods of time. The Internet has also made it easier for employers to make justified decisions about human resources. Employers can obtain information about their potential employees easily (such as through LinkedIn connections), thus allowing them to be more confident in hiring workers that can contribute to the company. As there is little skill mismatch because of the ability to do extensive research, the employees can remain at the company for longer periods of time without being fired because of lack of work performance. The increase in employment rate has a positive impact to the economy.   For AI: Negative impact on employment rate AI removes the need for existing low-level jobs such as data-entry clerks because it is able to fully replace them. This causes the less-educated to be at a risk of losing their jobs, thus increasing the unemployment rate when they become unemployed. The increase in unemployment rate has a negative impact to the economy. \n",

            "Sentence 240: good afternoon, our group will be debating on the impacts on AI and internet on society and will be arguing for the internet in terms of having a more profound impact on the following 4 aspects: education, economics, social and finally ethics.   --EDUCATION-- The internet and AI have both had significant impacts on education, but they have different effects on educational performance.   The internet has transformed the way students access information, communicate with others, and learn. It has made learning resources widely available and has provided access to educational opportunities to people who might not have had them otherwise. The internet has also facilitated the growth of online learning, which has expanded educational options and made education more accessible to students regardless of location.   On the other hand, AI has the potential to transform education in more profound ways. AI can personalize learning, providing students with individualized instruction based on their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. It can also provide real-time feedback to students, helping them to identify areas where they need improvement and providing guidance for how to improve. AI can also automate administrative tasks, allowing teachers to focus more on teaching and less on paperwork.   Overall, the internet currently has a more significant impact on education, however, AI has the potential to transform education in more profound and personalized ways. By leveraging the power of AI, education can become more tailored to individual students' needs and provide more effective feedback and support for student learning.   --SOCIAL-- The internet and artificial intelligence (AI) also have social impacts. Internet has been along longer and thus has a greater impact in terms of communication, learning and access of various services. It has brought people from all over the world closer together, breaking down barriers and improving access to information. The impact of the internet on society has been so significant that it has changed the way we conduct business, socialize, and even participate in politics.   While AI has also made significant advancements, its impact on society has been more limited. AI technologies such as self-driving cars and intelligent personal assistants have shown potential to improve convenience and efficiency, but their impact on fundamental access and connectivity issues is limited. Additionally, while AI may create new industries and job opportunities, its impact on economic growth is still in its early stages.   Thus, the internet has had a more profound impact on our society as compared to AI. Its adoption rate is higher, it has improved access and connectivity, and has had a more significant impact on education, healthcare, and social and political change. While AI has made significant advancements, its impact on society is still limited and requires careful consideration.   --ETHICS (FOR AI)-- While AI does pose some ethical challenges and concerns, it also has the potential to have a more profound positive impact on ethics than the internet. AI can be used to address issues of bias and discrimination by developing algorithms and systems that are fair and unbiased. For example, AI can be used to develop predictive policing models that are less biased and more accurate than traditional methods. AI can help improve decision-making in complex and high-stakes contexts, such as healthcare and criminal justice. By analyzing large amounts of data and identifying patterns, AI can help clinicians and judges make more informed and accurate decisions.   --REBUTTAL(AGAINST AI)-- While AI has the potential to challenge pre exisiting notions of societal ethics, as usual the internet has a greater impact due to how long it has been around. The internet has given people a platform to express themselves and share their ideas with a global audience, promoting freedom of expression and the exchange of diverse perspectives and opinions. Increased access to knowledge: The internet has democratized access to information and education, allowing people from all over the world to learn and acquire knowledge without the limitations of geography, economic resources, or social status.   The internet has enabled greater transparency and accountability in government, business, and other organizations by providing a platform for citizens to share information, expose wrongdoing, and hold those in power accountable. Increased collaboration and innovation: The internet has facilitated collaboration across different cultures and perspectives, leading to greater innovation and creativity. For example, open-source software development has enabled a global community of developers to collaborate on software projects, resulting in greater innovation and faster development cycles.   The internet has connected people from all over the world, allowing for greater empathy and understanding across different cultures and backgrounds.   --CONCLUSION-- In conclusion, while we acknowledge that AI has the potential to transform our world in profound ways, we believe that the internet has had a greater impact on our society as of now. It has revolutionized communication, transformed the way we work and do business, and impacted the social fabric of our society. The internet has enabled us to connect with others and share knowledge and ideas in ways that were not possible before, leading to a more connected and compassionate society. Going forward, there are plans in motion to integrate AI with internet use, as with Microsoft recent acquirement of OpenAI and with it chatgpt, with plans to build into their search engine Bing.\n",

            "Sentence 242: Opening statement: Ladies and gentlemen, the topic of today's debate is \"AI vs Internet, which one has more profound impact on our society?\" While both technologies have transformed our world in significant ways, we believe that the internet has had a more profound impact on our society.   First argument: The internet has revolutionized communication The internet has revolutionized communication in ways that were unimaginable just a few decades ago. Social media platforms and messaging apps have enabled people to connect with others from all over the world, building relationships and communities that would not have been possible before. The internet has also enabled people to share information and ideas more easily than ever before, democratizing knowledge and empowering people to engage in discussions and debates on a wide range of topics.   Second argument: The internet has transformed the way we work and do business The internet has transformed the way we work and do business, creating new business models and industries. E-commerce and online marketplaces have enabled people to buy and sell goods and services from anywhere in the world, creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs and small businesses. Remote work and telecommuting have become more prevalent, giving people the flexibility to work from anywhere and opening up new job opportunities.   Third argument: The internet has impacted the social fabric of our society The internet has impacted the social fabric of our society in profound ways. It has enabled the rise of online communities and social movements, allowing people to come together around shared interests and causes. It has also enabled people to maintain relationships with friends and family, even if they are geographically distant. The internet has enabled people to find support and solidarity in ways that were not possible before, leading to a more connected and compassionate society.   Counterargument: AI has the potential to transform nearly every aspect of our lives While it is true that the internet has had a profound impact on our society, it is important to acknowledge that AI has the potential to transform nearly every aspect of our lives. AI can analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns and insights that humans might miss, and make predictions that help us make better decisions. It has the potential to transform healthcare, transportation, finance, and education, among other fields.   Closing statement: In conclusion, while we acknowledge that AI has the potential to transform our world in profound ways, we believe that the internet has had a more profound impact on our society. It has revolutionized communication, transformed the way we work and do business, and impacted the social fabric of our society. The internet has enabled us to connect with others and share knowledge and ideas in ways that were not possible before, leading to a more connected and compassionate society.\n",

            "Sentence 453: Increase of security   Blockchain enhances security in several ways: Decentralization: In a traditional centralized database system, all data is stored in one location, making it a single point of failure. In contrast, a blockchain is decentralized, with multiple copies of the ledger stored across a network of computers. This makes it difficult for hackers to tamper with the data or bring down the network. Encryption: Blockchain uses advanced cryptography to protect the data stored on the network. Each transaction is encrypted and linked to the previous transaction in the chain, creating an unbreakable chain of blocks.
